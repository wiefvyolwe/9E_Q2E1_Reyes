			<p>Cardigan Welsh Corgis were described once as “smashing little dogs”. We’re not sure if there could be a more perfect description! Cardigans or Cardis, as they are nicknamed, are perfect family dogs and can adapt to almost any living situation. They were originally bred for cattle herding and are still excellent work dogs.</p>

		<td style="background: blue;">
			<p>The Golden Retriever truly is man’s best friend. Wonderful with family, an unparalleled service dog, and an active member in search-and-rescue missions this pup just has so much love to give. When your pup is little, always watch interactions with children. This breed tends to look at children as siblings and can play too rough with them in the beginning when unattended.</p>

		<td style="background: green;">
			<p>No, this isn’t a briefing on cryptocurrency, it’s an introduction to one of the sweetest furry friends around. Shiba Inu, the pride of Japan, was once an excellent hunter, now a top-notch guard dog and companion. They are confident, daring and poised, though sometimes aloof.</p>
